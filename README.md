Is the Regime Shift in Gulf Stream Warm Core Rings Evident in Satellite Altimetry? An Inter-comparison of Eddy Identification and Tracking Products

Motivation:
Gangopadhyay et al., 2019 found a regime shift in the number of warm core rings formations between 1980–1999 and 2000–2017. Silver et al., 2021 expanded upon this work and also found a regime shift in warm core rings, but no regime shift in cold core rings. We seek to understand if a regime shift, and similar results, can be detected using a global mesoscale eddy dataset such as META2.0.

The goal of this work is to:
Repeat similar analyses as Silver et al., 2021 for eddy datasets that have been filtered to only include warm core ring- and cold core ring-like eddies
Check if these eddy datasets detect a regime shift in Gulf Stream rings
Analyize the formation patterns, seasonal cycles, and formation trends of the eddies
Test if META2.0 and similar products could be used to study Gulf Stream rings
Note: The META2.0 dataset, or Chelton eddy tracks, are no longer recommended for use. Instead, AVISO reccomends using META3.1EXP. When this project began, that warning did not exist and META3.1EXP had not been published. Hence why we primarily use the META2.0 dataset.

Datasets:
☆The Altimetric Mesoscale Eddy Trajectories Atlas (META2.0)
The primary dataset used in this notebook is The Altimetric Mesoscale Eddy Trajectories Atlas (META2.0). Schlax & Chelton, 2016 give a product description of META2.0, which built upon Chelton et al., 2011.

The Mesoscale Eddy Trajectories Atlas (META3.1EXP)
The Mesoscale Eddy Trajectories Atlas Product Verison 3.1 Experimental (META3.1EXP) was first published in March 2022 and is an update to META2.0. The details of this product are described in Pegliasco et al., 2022 which inherited an eddy-tracking algorithm developed by Mason et al., 2014 that is inpsired by Chelton et al., 2011.

The Global Lagrangian Eddy Dataset (GLED v1.0)
The third eddy product differs from the META datasets because it uses Lagrangian methods to identify and track eddies. This dataset was created by Liu and Abernathy, 2023 as the Lagrangian alternative to Eulerian eddy products like META2.0 and all the successive Eulerian eddy products inspired by Chelton et al., 2011.

Yearly census of Gulf Stream Warm Core Ring formation from 1980 to 2017
The WCR census uses the Clark charts to document the formation and demise dates, locations, and the area at formation for all WCRs formed between 1980 and 2017 that lived for a week or more.
