# CHATTS - Project Overview
Cape HATteras Time Series (CHATTS) proposes to utilize observations from the HFR installations near Cape Hatteras, NC, to develop metrics to characterizethe GS within this key oceanographic region. The 3 investigative questions of this project are: 
1) What controls the time-varying location (i.e., the “separation location”) where the GS veers away from the continental margin to flow into the open ocean? 
2) How are GS meanders and the associated cross-isobath exchanges at Cape  Hatteras  related  to  “upstream”  variability  (i.e.,  from  the Charleston Bump and Florida Straits)?
3) Does GS variability at Cape Hatteras cause “downstream” variability (i.e., in  the  separated  GS, over  the  outer  MAB  shelf/upper  slope,and  along  the  seaward portion of the Slope Sea)?

With the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts stored in this repo I hope to primarily investigate question 2 because "Glenn  and  Ebbesmeyer (1994) also observed varying meander properties, further noting that the large amplitude meanders were more likely to have warm filaments that penetrated  onto  the  shelf  and  attributed  the  transition  between  deflection  states  to  offshore forcing  by CCRs" (CHATTS proposal).
